## About the Video Course
Have you ever thought of combining the power of Redux and reactive JavaScript to build a responsive and reactive application? Well then, this course is your ideal choice to manage state in Angular to write reactive apps.
This course will help you build Angular applications by incorporating reactive programming principles and making it easier to develop, test, and debug your applications.
Throughout the nine sections, the extensive examples will help you implement state management with Redux, create observables, and handle errors with RxJS. You will first explore NgRx to set up the state, add a store, debug its state, and customize the saved router state. After that, you will learn to handle side effects and add support to your app.
You’ll learn to reduce the boilerplate code and use blueprints for scaffolding out features. This course will not only empower you to use Redux and NgRx to the fullest but will also help you build your own micro implementation of NgRx for a database-backed app.
